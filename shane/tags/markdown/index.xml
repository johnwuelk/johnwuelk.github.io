      <description>Limestone and sandstone are both popular building materials, but with key differences:&#xA;Durability: Limestone is denser and harder, making it more resistant to scratches and wear. Sandstone is softer and can be easier to work with, but may require more care to avoid damage.&#xA;Maintenance: Limestone generally requires less upkeep due to its lower porosity. Sandstone can be more prone to staining and needs careful cleaning to avoid using harsh chemicals.</description>
